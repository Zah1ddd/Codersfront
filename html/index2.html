    <h1>Robert Downey Jr</h1>
    <h2 id="early">Early life</h2>
    <hr>
    <div><p><b>Robert John Downey Jr</b> was born on April 4, 1965, in Manhattan, New York City, the younger of two children.
        His
        father, Robert Downey Sr., was an actor and filmmaker, while his mother, Elsie Ann (née Ford), was an actress
        who appeared in Downey Sr.'s films. Downey's father was of half Lithuanian Jewish, one-quarter Hungarian Jewish,
        and one-quarter Irish descent, while Downey's mother had Scottish, German, and Swiss ancestry. He and his older
        sister Allyson grew up in Greenwich VillageAs a child, Downey was "surrounded by drugs." His father, a drug
        addict, allowed Downey to use marijuana at age six, an incident which his father later said he regretted.
        Downey later stated that drug use became an emotional bond between him and his father: "When my dad and I would
        do drugs together, it was like him trying to express his love for me in the only way he knew how." Eventually,
        Downey began spending every night abusing alcohol and "making a thousand phone calls in pursuit of drugs</p></div>

    <h2>Career</h2>
       
    <div><p> Despite all of the critical success Downey had experienced throughout his career, he had not appeared in a
        "blockbuster" film. That changed in 2008 when Downey starred in two critically and commercially successful
        films, Iron Man and Tropic Thunder. In the article Ben Stiller wrote for Downey's entry in the 2008 edition of
        The Time 100, he offered an observation on Downey's commercially successful summer at the box office:

        Yes, Downey is Iron Man, but he really is Actor Man ... In the realm where box office is irrelevant and talent
        is king, the realm that actually means something, he has always ruled, and finally this summer he gets to have
        his cake and let us eat him up all the way to the multiplex, where his mastery is in full effect.

        — Ben Stiller, The 2008 Time 100, entry No. 60, "Robert Downey Jr."
        In 2007, Downey was cast as the title character in the film Iron Man, with director Jon Favreau explaining the
        choice by stating: "Downey wasn't the most obvious choice, but he understood what makes the character tick. He
        found a lot of his own life experience in 'Tony Stark'." Favreau insisted on having Downey as he repeatedly
        claimed that Downey would be to Iron Man what Johnny Depp is to the Pirates of the Caribbean series: a lead
        actor who could both elevate the quality of the film and increase the public's interest in it. For the role,
        Downey had to gain more than 20 pounds (9 kilograms) of muscle in five months to look like he "had the power to
        forge iron".</p></div>
    <div><p id="career">Iron Man was released worldwide between April 30 and May 3, 2008, grossing over $585 million
        worldwide and receiving rave reviews which cited Downey's performance as a highlight of the film. By October
        2008, Downey had agreed to star in two Iron Man sequels, as part of the Iron Man franchise, as well as The
        Avengers, featuring the superhero team that Stark joins, based on Marvel's comic book series The Avengers. He
        first reprised the role in a small appearance as Iron Man's alter ego Tony Stark in the 2008 film The Incredible
        Hulk, as a part of Marvel Studios' depicting the same Marvel Universe on film by providing continuity among the
        movies.</p></div>

    <h2>Political views</h2>
    <div><p>In a 2008 interview, Downey stated that his time in prison changed his political point of view somewhat, saying:
        "I have a really interesting political point of view, and it's not always something I say too loud at dinner
        tables here, but you can't go from a $2,000-a-night suite at La Mirage to a penitentiary and really understand
        it and come out a liberal. You can't. I wouldn't wish that experience on anyone else, but it was very, very,
        very educational for me and has informed my proclivities and politics ever since." However, when asked
        about the quote in a 2015 interview to promote Avengers: Age of Ultron, he denied that his previous statement
        reflected any longstanding beliefs on his part, and stated: "I wouldn't say that I'm a Republican or a liberal
        or a Democrat.</p></div>
   <div><p id="Political">In January 2020, during the promotions of his film Dolittle, Downey announced that he had
        made the decision to adopt a vegan diet, in response to the debate about the climate crisis, stating that "I'm a
        one-man carbon footprint nightmare colossus" and believes he can do his part to contribute. Downey previously
        announced his opening of The Footprint Coalition, an organization he launched to reduce carbon footprints around
        the world using advanced technology.The Footprint Coalition promotes technologies that protect the environment
        such as French insect-farming startup Ynsect,the bio-based alternative to plastic manufacturer RWDC,and
        bamboo toilet paper manufacturer Cloud Paper.</p></div>
